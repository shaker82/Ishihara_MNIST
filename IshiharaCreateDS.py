   This Script can be used to transform circled MNIST into one of the Ishihara plates.
   It also contains uncolored manipulation functions.
   Examples:
            Creating the plate "only circles":
            ```
            python IshiharaCreateDS.py --data_path Output\\PFiles --out_path Output \
            --plate 20 --manipulation 1
            ```
            Creating the plate 1:
            ```
            python IshiharaCreateDS.py --data_path Output\\PFiles --out_path Output \
            --plate 1 --manipulation 1
            ```
            Creating the plate 4 with above_line manipulation:
            ```
            python IshiharaCreateDS.py --data_path Output\\PFiles --out_path Output \
            --plate 4 --manipulation 4
            ```
