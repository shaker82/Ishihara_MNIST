   This Script can be used to transform images into tensors and vice versa.
   Examples:
        Export images to pickle files (only 10 images from each folder):
        ```
            python IshiharaImagesExportImport.py --Plate_path Output\\Only_Circles \
            --output_path Output --out_folder_name Only_Circles_pickle --mode 0 \
            --MaxImages 5
        ```
        Export tensors in pickle files into images (only 10 images from each folder):
        ```
            python IshiharaImagesExportImport.py --Plate_path \
            Output\\Only_Circles_pickle --output_path Output --out_folder_name \
            Only_Circles_new --mode 1 --MaxImages 10
        ```
